# The variable empCount is a class variable whose value is shared among all instances of a this class. 
# This can be accessed as Employee.empCount from inside the class or outside the class.

#The first method __init__() is a special method, which is called class constructor 
#or initialization method that Python calls when you create a new instance of this class.

#You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the 
# first argument to each method is self. 
# Python adds the self argument to the list for you; 
# you do not need to include it when you call the methods.
